Serind’s Front End Take Home Test

Stack to use: -[X] ReactJS (Required) -[X] React hooks (Required) -[X] TypeScript (Optional)

- Use any other libraries you like

Your Mission:
Your mission is to create a single page app (SPA) using the OMDB API
(http://www.omdbapi.com/). Your application should have 2 pages, one for showing
movie list and second for showing movie details.

Your Tasks:

- We want to see a functional site that uses the api. If you have any doubts, feel free to
  make assumptions. Functionality is more important than the look and feel. If you finish
  early, feel free to polish it up.
- Your SPA should have these 2 pages:
- Movie list page (first page)
- [x] Users should see a blank form when they first come to this page. This
      form should contain below fields:
- [x] Search field (text) (required)
- [x] Type (select) (optional) (options - movie, series, episode)
- [x] Year (text) (optional)
- [x] Search button
- [x] Add form validations
- [x] User should be able to search by filling form and then clicking on “Search”
      button
- [x] User should be able to see results on the same page below form
- For each movie, user should be able to view
- [x] Title
- [x] Image
- [x] Year
- [x] Type (movie, series, episode)

- [x] Users should be able to view details of movies by clicking on the
      “Detail” button present in each movie row. On click of this button,
      user should be taken to Movie detail page

- Movie detail page (second page)
- [x] Users should see the “Back” button on this page. On click of this button,
      user should be taken back to Movie list page (Please note: Movie list
      page state should be preserved i.e. form field values and movie list
      should be populated)
- User should be able to view below fields on this page:
- [x] Title
- [x] Image
- [x] Year
- [x] Type
- [x] Released
- [x] Genre
- [x] Ratings
